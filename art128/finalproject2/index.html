            <h3>Good Food, Good Coffee, Good People</h3>
            <p>Sure Shot Cafe does not accept being a "specialty" shop. Providing not only good food, good coffee, but also good people (we take pride in our employees and the customers we have cultivated). Originally known as Village Espresso, our current owner came down to get a cup of java with her dad one day in '97 after hearing thru the grapevine that there was a cafe she had never heard of for sale. "What a nifty place this is.." agreed the two. Before you know it...BADA-Bing, BADA-Bang! Sure Shot Cafe was born in 1998.</p>
